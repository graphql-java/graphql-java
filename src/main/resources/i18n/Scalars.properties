#
# This resource bundle is used for the scalar code to produce i18n messages
#
# The keys have the format of rule class name and then message type within that.  Most rules
# will only have 1 or 2 message keys
#
# Please try and keep this sorted within rule class and use # between sections so the IDEA Ctrl-Alt-L reformat does not bunch
# them too tightly.
#
# REMEMBER - a single quote ' in MessageFormat means things that are never replaced within them
# so use 2 '' characters to make it one ' on output.  This will take for the form ''{0}''
#

ID.notId=Expected a value that can be converted to type ''ID'' but it was a ''{0}''
