/**
 * Executor that provides mutual exclusion between the operations submitted to it,
 * without blocking.
 * <p>
 * If an operation is submitted to this executor while no other operation is
 * running, it will run immediately.
 * <p>
 * If an operation is submitted to this executor while another operation is
 * running, it will be added to a queue of operations to run, and the executor will
 * return. The thread currently running an operation will end up running the
 * operation just submitted.
 * <p>
 * Operations submitted to this executor should run fast, as they can end up running
 * on other threads and interfere with the operation of other threads.
 * <p>
 * This executor can also be used to address infinite recursion problems, as
 * operations submitted recursively will run sequentially.
 * <p>
