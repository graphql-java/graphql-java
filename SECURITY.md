# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

## Reporting a Vulnerability

:rotating_light: To report a vulnerability, **DO NOT open a pull request or issue or GitHub discussion. DO NOT post publicly.**

Instead, **report the vulnerability privately** via the Security tab on [graphql-java GitHub repository](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java). See instructions at https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability
