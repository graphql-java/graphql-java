# graphql-java

This is a GraphQL Java implementation based on the [specification]((https://github.com/facebook/graphql) 
and the JavaScript [reference implementation](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js). 
   
It's an early version, but the query parser should be near 100%.

The execution part is WIP, and validation, error handling and more is still missing.  

For a very simple (yet complete) test how to use graphql-java: [src/test/groovy/graphql/parser/GrapqQLTest.groovy]
