Thanks for contributing to graphql-java!


Please be sure that you read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing to this project and please
create a new Issue and discuss first what your are planning to do for bigger changes.


The overall goal of graphql-java is to have a correct implementation of the [GraphQL Spec](https://github.com/facebook/graphql/) in a production ready way.

In order to achieve that we have a strong focus on maintainability and high test coverage:

- We expect new or modified unit test for every change (written in [Spock](http://spockframework.org/)).

- Your code should be formatted with our IntelliJ [graphql-java-code-style](graphql-java-code-style.xml).

- We don't add a new dependency to graphql-java: dependency conflicts will make adaption of graphql-java harder for users,
therefore we avoid adding any new dependency.

- graphql-java has a strict focus on executing a GraphQL request, this means JSON parsing, http communication, databases
access etc is out of scope.


If you have any question please consider asking in our [Discussions](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/discussions). For bug reports or specific code related topics create a new issue.

Thanks!
