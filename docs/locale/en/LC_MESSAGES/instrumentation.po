"The ``graphql.execution.instrumentation.Instrumentation`` interface "
"allows you to inject code that can observe the execution of a query and "
"also change the runtime behaviour."
msgstr ""

#: ../../instrumentation.rst:8
msgid ""
"The primary use case for this is to allow say performance monitoring and "
"custom logging but it could be used for many different purposes."

"When you build the ```Graphql`` object you can specify what "
"``Instrumentation`` to use (if any)."

#: ../../instrumentation.rst:22
msgid ""
"An implementation of ``Instrumentation`` needs to implement the \"begin\""
" step methods that represent the execution of a graphql query."

#: ../../instrumentation.rst:24
msgid ""
"Each step must give back a non null "
"``graphql.execution.instrumentation.InstrumentationContext`` object which"
" will be called back when the step completes, and will be told that it "
"succeeded or failed with a Throwable."

#: ../../instrumentation.rst:27
msgid ""
"The following is a basic custom ``Instrumentation`` that measures overall"
" execution time and puts it into a stateful object."

msgid "Chaining Instrumentation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../instrumentation.rst:115
msgid ""
"You can combine multiple ``Instrumentation`` objects together using the "
"``graphql.execution.instrumentation.ChainedInstrumentation`` class which "
"accepts a list of ``Instrumentation`` objects and calls them in that "
"defined order."

msgid "Apollo Tracing Instrumentation"

#: ../../instrumentation.rst:134
msgid ""
"``graphql.execution.instrumentation.tracing.TracingInstrumentation`` is "

#: ../../instrumentation.rst:263
msgid ""
"``graphql.execution.instrumentation.fieldvalidation.FieldValidationInstrumentation``"
" is an ``Instrumentation`` implementation that can be used to validate "
"fields and their arguments before query execution.  If errors are "
"returned during this process then the query execution is aborted and the "
"errors will be in the query result."
msgstr ""

#: ../../instrumentation.rst:267
msgid ""
"You can make you own custom implementation of ``FieldValidation`` or you "
"can use the ``SimpleFieldValidation`` class to add simple per field "
"checks rules."
