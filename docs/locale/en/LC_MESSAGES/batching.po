"If you are using ``graphql``, you are likely to making queries on a graph"
" of data (surprise surprise).  But its easy to implement inefficient code"
" with naive loading of a graph of data."

msgid ""
"Using ``java-dataloader`` will help you to make this a more efficient "
"process by both caching and batching requests for that graph of data "
"items.  If ``dataloader`` has seen a data item before, it will have "
"cached the value and will return it without having to ask for it again."

"Imagine we have the StarWars query outlined below.  It asks us to find a "
"hero and their friend's names and their friend's friend's names.  It is "
"likely that many of these people will be friends in common."

"The result of this query is displayed below. You can see that Han, Leia, "
"Luke and R2-D2 are a tight knit bunch of friends and share many friends "
"in common."

"A naive implementation would called a `DataFetcher` to retrieved a person"
" object every time it was invoked."

"In this case it would be *15* calls over the network.  Even though the "
"group of people have a lot of common friends. With `dataloader` you can "
"make the `graphql` query much more efficient."
msgstr ""

#: ../../batching.rst:47
msgid ""
"As `graphql` descends each level of the query ( eg as it processes `hero`"
" and then `friends` and then for each their `friends`), the data loader "
"is called to \"promise\" to deliver a person object.  At each level "
"`dataloader.dispatch()` will be called to fire off the batch requests for"
" that part of the query. With caching turned on (the default) then any "
"previously returned person will be returned as is for no cost."
msgstr ""

#: ../../batching.rst:52
msgid ""
"In the above example there are only *5* unique people mentioned but with "
"caching and batching retrieval in place their will be only *3* calls to "
"the batch loader function.  *3* calls over the network or to a database "
"is much better than *15* calls you will agree."
msgstr ""

#: ../../batching.rst:55
msgid ""
"If you use capabilities like "
"`java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture.supplyAsync()` then you can make "
"it even more efficient by making the the remote calls asynchronous to the"
" rest of the query.  This will make it even more timely since multiple "
"calls can happen at once if need be."

"One thing to note is the above only works if you use "
"`DataLoaderDispatcherInstrumentation` which makes sure "
"`dataLoader.dispatch()` is called.  If this was not in place, then all "
"the promises to data will never be dispatched ot the batch loader "
"function and hence nothing would ever resolve."

"If you are serving web requests then the data can be specific to the user"
" requesting it. If you have user specific data then you will not want to "
"cache data meant for user A to then later give it to user B in a "
"subsequent request."
msgstr ""

#: ../../batching.rst:133
msgid ""
"The scope of your DataLoader instances is important. You might want to "
"create them per web request to ensure data is only cached within that web"
" request and no more."

#: ../../batching.rst:136
msgid ""
"If your data can be shared across web requests then you might want to "
"scope your data loaders so they survive longer than the web request say."
msgstr ""

#: ../../batching.rst:139
msgid ""
"But if you are doing per request data loaders then creating a new set of "
"``GraphQL`` and ``DataLoader`` objects per request is super cheap.  Its "
"the ``GraphQLSchema`` creation that can be expensive, especially if you "
"are using graphql SDL parsing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../batching.rst:142
msgid ""
"Structure your code so that the schema is statically held, perhaps in a "
"static variable or in a singleton IoC component but build out a new "
"``GraphQL`` set of objects on each request."
