msgid "Data Fetchers"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:36
msgid ""
"Each graphql field type has a ``graphql.schema.DataFetcher`` associated "
"with it.  Other graphql implementations often call this type of code "
"*resolvers**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:39
msgid ""
"Often you can rely on ``graphql.schema.PropertyDataFetcher`` to examine "
"Java POJO objects to provide field values from them.  If your don't "
"specify a data fetcher on a field, this is what will be used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:42
msgid ""
"However you will need to fetch your top level domain objects via your own"
" custom data fetchers.  This might involve making a database call or "
"contacting another system over HTTP say."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:45
msgid ""
"``graphql-java`` is not opinionated about how you get your domain data "
"objects, that is very much your concern.  It is also not opinionated on "
"user authorisation to that data.  You should push all that logic into "
"your business logic layer code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:48
msgid "A data fetcher might look like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:59
msgid ""
"Each ``DataFetcher`` is passed a "
"``graphql.schema.DataFetchingEnvironment`` object which contains what "
"field is being fetched, what arguments have been supplied to the field "
"and other information such as the field's parent object, the query root "
"object or the query context object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:63
msgid ""
"In the above example, the execution will wait for the data fetcher to "
"return before moving on.  You can make execution of the ``DataFetcher`` "
"asynchronous by returning a ``CompletionStage`` to data, that is "
"explained more further down this page."

msgid "Exceptions while fetching data"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:69
msgid ""
"If an exception happens during the data fetcher call, then the execution "
"strategy by default will make a ``graphql.ExceptionWhileDataFetching`` "
"error and add it to the list of errors on the result.  Remember graphql "
"allows partial results with errors."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:73
msgid "Here is the code for the standard behaviour."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:92
msgid ""
"If the exception you throw is itself a `GraphqlError` then it will "
"transfer the message and custom extensions attributes from that exception"
" into the `ExceptionWhileDataFetching` object.  This allows you to place "
"your own custom attributes into the graphql error that is sent back to "
"the caller."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:96
msgid ""
"For example imagine your data fetcher threw this exception.  The `foo` "
"and `fizz` attributes would be included in the resultant graphql error."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:122
msgid ""
"You can change this behaviour by creating your own "
"``graphql.execution.DataFetcherExceptionHandler`` exception handling code"
" and giving that to the execution strategy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:125
msgid ""
"For example the code above records the underlying exception and stack "
"trace.  Some people may prefer not to see that in the output error list."
"  So you can use this mechanism to change that behaviour."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:141
msgid "Serializing results to JSON"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:143
msgid ""
"The most common way to call graphql is over HTTP and to expect a JSON "
"response back.  So you need to turn an `graphql.ExecutionResult` into a "
"JSON payload."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:146
msgid ""
"A common way to do that is use a JSON serialisation library like Jackson "
"or GSON.  However exactly how they interpret the data result is "
"particular to them.  For example `nulls` are important in graphql results"
" and hence you must set up the json mappers to include them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:150
msgid ""
"To ensure you get a JSON result that confirms 100% to the graphql spec, "
"you should call `toSpecification` on the result and then send that back "
"as JSON."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:153
msgid ""
"This will ensure that the result follows the specification outlined in "
"http://facebook.github.io/graphql/#sec-Response"

msgid "Mutations"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:169
msgid ""
"A good starting point to learn more about mutating data in graphql is "
"`http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations "
"<http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations>`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:171
msgid ""
"In essence you need to define a ``GraphQLObjectType`` that takes "
"arguments as input.  Those arguments are what you can use to mutate your "
"data store via the data fetcher invoked."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:174
msgid "The mutation is invoked via a query like :"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:185
msgid ""
"You need to send in arguments during that mutation operation, in this "
"case for the variables for ``$ep`` and ``$review``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:187
msgid "You would create types like this to handle this mutation :"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:241
msgid ""
"Notice that the input arguments are of type ``GraphQLInputObjectType``.  "
"This is important.  Input arguments can ONLY be of that type and you "
"cannot use output types such as ``GraphQLObjectType``.  Scalars types are"
" consider both input and output types."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:244
msgid ""
"The data fetcher here is responsible for executing the mutation and "
"returning some sensible output values."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:277
msgid ""
"Notice how it calls a data store to mutate the backing database and then "
"returns a ``Review`` object that can be used as the output values to the "
"caller."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:281
msgid "Asynchronous Execution"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:283
msgid ""
"graphql-java uses fully asynchronous execution techniques when it "
"executes queries.  You can get the ``CompleteableFuture`` to results by "
"calling ``executeAsync()`` like this"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:302
msgid ""
"The use of ``CompletableFuture`` allows you to compose actions and "
"functions that will be applied when the execution completes.  The final "
"call to ``.join()`` waits for the execution to happen."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:305
msgid ""
"In fact under the covers, the graphql-java engine uses asynchronous "
"execution and makes the ``.execute()`` method appear synchronous by "
"calling join for you.  So the following code is in fact the same."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:319
msgid ""
"If a ``graphql.schema.DataFetcher`` returns a ``CompletableFuture<T>`` "
"object then this will be composed into the overall asynchronous query "
"execution.  This means you can fire off a number of field fetching "
"requests in parallel.  Exactly what threading strategy you use is up to "
"your data fetcher code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:323
msgid ""
"The following code uses the standard Java "
"``java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.commonPool()`` thread executor to "
"supply values in another thread."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:338
msgid ""
"The code above is written in long form.  With Java 8 lambdas it can be "
"written more succinctly as follows"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:345
msgid ""
"The graphql-java engine ensures that all the ``CompletableFuture`` "
"objects are composed together to provide an execution result that follows"
" the graphql specification."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:348
msgid ""
"There is a helpful shortcut in graphql-java to create asynchronous data "
"fetchers. Use ``graphql.schema.AsyncDataFetcher.async(DataFetcher<T>)`` "
"to wrap a ``DataFetcher``. This can be used with static imports to "
"produce more readable code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:357
msgid "Execution Strategies"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:359
msgid ""
"A class derived from ``graphql.execution.ExecutionStrategy`` is used to "
"run a query or mutation.  A number of different strategies are provided "
"with graphql-java and if you are really keen you can even write your own."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:362
msgid ""
"You can wire in what execution strategy to use when you create the "
"``GraphQL`` object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:372
msgid ""
"In fact the code above is equivalent to the default settings and is a "
"very sensible choice of execution strategies for most cases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:376
msgid "AsyncExecutionStrategy"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:378
msgid ""
"By default the \"query\" execution strategy is "
"``graphql.execution.AsyncExecutionStrategy`` which will dispatch each "
"field as ``CompleteableFuture`` objects and not care which ones complete "
"first.  This strategy allows for the most performant execution."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:382
msgid ""
"The data fetchers invoked can themselves return `CompletionStage`` values"
" and this will create fully asynchronous behaviour."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:385
msgid "So imagine a query as follows"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:401
msgid ""
"The ``AsyncExecutionStrategy`` is free to dispatch the *enemies* field at"
" the same time as the *friends* field.  It does not have to do *enemies* "
"first followed by *friends*, which would be less efficient."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:404
msgid ""
"It will however assemble the results in order.  The query result will "
"follow the graphql specification and return object values assembled in "
"query field order.  Only the execution of data fetching is free to be in "
"any order."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:407
msgid ""
"This behaviour is allowed in the graphql specification and in fact is "
"actively encouraged http://facebook.github.io/graphql/#sec-Query for read"
" only queries."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:410
msgid ""
"See `specification <http://facebook.github.io/graphql/#sec-Normal-"
"evaluation>`_ for details."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:414
msgid "AsyncSerialExecutionStrategy"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:416
msgid ""
"The graphql specification says that mutations MUST be executed serially "
"and in the order in which the query fields occur."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:419
msgid ""
"So ``graphql.execution.AsyncSerialExecutionStrategy`` is used by default "
"for mutations and will ensure that each field is completed before it "
"processes the next one and so forth.  You can still return "
"``CompletionStage`` objects in the mutation data fetchers, however they "
"will be executed serially and will be completed before the next mutation "
"field data fetcher is dispatched."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:425
msgid "ExecutorServiceExecutionStrategy"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:427
msgid ""
"The ``graphql.execution.ExecutorServiceExecutionStrategy`` execution "
"strategy will always dispatch each field fetch in an asynchronous manner,"
" using the executor you give it.  It differs from "
"``AsyncExecutionStrategy`` in that it does not rely on the data fetchers "
"to be asynchronous but rather makes the field fetch invocation "
"asynchronous by submitting each field to the provided "
"`java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:432
msgid ""
"This behaviour makes it unsuitable to be used as a mutation execution "
"strategy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:450
msgid "SubscriptionExecutionStrategy"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:452
msgid ""
"Graphql subscriptions allows you to create stateful subscriptions to "
"graphql data.  You uses ``SubscriptionExecutionStrategy`` as your "
"execution strategy as it has the support for the reactive-streams APIs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:455
msgid ""
"See http://www.reactive-streams.org/ for more information on the reactive"
" ``Publisher`` and ``Subscriber`` interfaces."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:457
msgid ""
"Also see the page on subscriptions for more details on how to write a "
"subscription based graphql service."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:461
msgid "BatchedExecutionStrategy"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:463
msgid ""
"Alternatively, schemas with nested lists may benefit from using a "
"``graphql.execution.batched.BatchedExecutionStrategy`` and creating "
"batched DataFetchers with get() methods annotated @Batched."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:468
msgid ""
"on how BatchedExecutionStrategy works here.  Its a pretty special case "
"that I don't know how to explain properly"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:471
msgid "Limiting Field Visibility"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:473
msgid ""
"By default every fields defined in a `GraphqlSchema` is available.  There"
" are cases where you may want to restrict certain fields depending on the"
" user."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:476
msgid ""
"You can do this by using a "
"`graphql.schema.visibility.GraphqlFieldVisibility` implementation and "
"attaching it to the schema."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:478
msgid ""
"A simple `graphql.schema.visibility.BlockedFields` implementation based "
"on fully qualified field name is provided."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:493
msgid ""
"There is also another implementation that prevents instrumentation from "
"being able to be performed on your schema, if that is a requirement."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:495
msgid ""
"Note that this puts your server in contravention of the graphql "
"specification and expectations of most clients so use this with caution."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:506
msgid ""
"You can create your own derivation of `GraphqlFieldVisibility` to check "
"what ever you need to do to work out what fields should be visible or "
"not."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:542
msgid "Query Caching"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:544
msgid ""
"Before the ``graphql-java`` engine executes a query it must be parsed and"
" validated, and this process can be somewhat time consuming."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:546
msgid ""
"To avoid the need for re-parse/validate the ``GraphQL.Builder`` allows an"
" instance of ``PreparsedDocumentProvider`` to reuse ``Document`` "
"instances."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:548
msgid ""
"Please note that this does not cache the result of the query, only the "
"parsed ``Document``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:558
msgid ""
"Create an instance of preferred cache instance, here is `Caffeine "
"<https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine>`_  used as it is a high quality "
"caching solution. The cache instance should be thread safe and shared."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:559
msgid ""
"The ``PreparsedDocumentProvider`` is a functional interface with only a "
"get method and we can therefore pass a method reference that matches the "
"signature into the builder."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:562
msgid ""
"In order to achieve high cache hit ration it is recommended that field "
"arguments are passed in as variables instead of directly in the query."
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:564
msgid "The following query:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:574
msgid "Should be rewritten as:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:584
msgid "with variables:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../execution.rst:592
msgid "The query is now reused regardless of variable values provided."
